# About

This is now my third dotfiles repo and hope this is the final solution. For The 
first few repos:

1. Wrote a script to manually symlink things (became too complicated)
2. Created a bare git repo with working tree as `$HOME`
	- Using an alias or function instead of git caused problems
	- 
3. Now I have bit the bullet and started using 
[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot.git) that does all of the work.
	- Now I am back to symlinks.
	- Dotbot is embedded in this repo as a submodule
	- Configuration for install script is maintained in install.conf.yaml

We will see how it goes
