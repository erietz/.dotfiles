# About

- This is a tiling window manager that seems to be better than amethyst.
- I followed the minimal install

`brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai`

`brew services start yabai`

The keybindings are controlled by a different program `skhd`


``` sh
# stop, upgrade, start yabai
brew services stop yabai
brew upgrade yabai
brew services start yabai
```
